# DICOM Whole-Slide Imaging (WSI) rendering

How a gigapixel pathology slide stored as DICOM is served and rendered by the
same machinery that handles OME-Zarr. The server side is implemented and
verified; the browser render-finish is the open work (see section 6).

---

## 1. Strategy in one line

A WSI is a 2D multi-resolution image, so model each pyramid level as a
**depth-1 RGB volume** `[W, H, 1]` (`dtype: 'rgb24'`). Then the OME-Zarr
pyramid + bbox-subvolume streaming path (`probeLevels` / `loadLevel` /
`loadSubvolume`, LRU chunk residency, coarse-first LOD) serves whole slides
**unchanged** — no new server route and no new render path.

---

## 2. What a DICOM WSI series actually is

A series is a set of multi-frame instances, one instance per pyramid level,
plus ancillary images. Ground truth from the tracked CPTAC-BRCA fixture
(`fetch-dicom-wsi` default series `37cb2625`, ~487 MB):

| Instance role | Total matrix (W×H) | Tiles | Codec |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| VOLUME (L0 base) | 53783 × 49534 (2.66 GP) | 46575 | JPEG baseline |
| VOLUME (L1) | 13445 × 12383 | 2964 | JPEG baseline |
| VOLUME (L2) | 3361 × 3095 | 195 | JPEG baseline |
| VOLUME (L3) | 1680 × 1547 | 49 | JPEG baseline |
| LABEL / OVERVIEW / THUMBNAIL | small | 1 | uncompressed |

Key DICOM tags (all read before PixelData, so a header-only chunk read probes
even the 422 MB base instance):

- `TotalPixelMatrixColumns/Rows` (0048,0006 / 0048,0007) — level size in px.
- `Columns/Rows` (0028,0011 / 0028,0010) — tile size (240×240 here).
- `NumberOfFrames` (0028,0008) — tile count.
- `DimensionOrganizationType` (0020,9311) = **TILED_FULL** — implicit raster
  tile order, **column index fastest then row**, so a tile's frame index is
  pure arithmetic; no Per-Frame Functional Groups read needed.
- `PhotometricInterpretation` (0028,0004) — authoritative color space.
- `TransferSyntaxUID` (0002,0010) — drives codec / encapsulation detection.

The TILED_FULL invariant (verified against all 4 levels in
`dicomWsi.test.ts`): `tilesAcross = ceil(W / tileW)`,
`tilesDown = ceil(H / tileH)`, `tilesAcross * tilesDown == NumberOfFrames`,
and `frame(col, row) = row * tilesAcross + col`.

---

## 3. Server implementation (done)

`apps/iiif-volumetric-server/src/adapters/`

- **`dicomWsi.ts`** — pure, unit-tested: tag keys, `readInstanceMeta`,
  `buildPyramid` (keep VOLUME tiers, sort highest-resolution first, number
  0..N), tile geometry (`tilesAcross` / `frameIndexForTile` /
  `tileRangeForBbox`), `isEncapsulatedTransferSyntax`, `jpegColorTransform`.
- **`dicom.ts`** — the `VolumeAdapter`: `dicom-parser` for encapsulated
  per-frame extraction (`createJPEGBasicOffsetTable` +
  `readEncapsulatedImageFrame`), `jpeg-js` for baseline decode, per-level
  caching of the parsed dataset + basic offset table.
  - `probe` / `probeLevels` — `[W, H, 1]` shapes, header-only.
  - `loadLevel(i)` — decode every tile of a coarse tier into one rgb24
    volume; capped at `MAX_WHOLE_LEVEL_BYTES` (768 MB) so the base tier is
    never materialised whole.
  - `loadSubvolume(i, bbox)` — `tileRangeForBbox` → decode only the covering
    frames → `blitTile` crops/composites them into the requested slab. This
    is the deep-zoom path for L0/L1.

### Two non-obvious correctness points (both cost real debugging)

1. **Encapsulation must come from `TransferSyntaxUID`, not the PixelData
   element.** The header-only metadata read stops *before* PixelData, so
   inferring "compressed" from the pixel element's length is wrong and silently
   sends JPEG bytes down the uncompressed path → pure noise. Detect from the
   transfer syntax (JPEG family `1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.*`, RLE `...1.2.5`).
2. **The JPEG color transform must follow `PhotometricInterpretation`.** These
   CPTAC frames are `RGB` but carry an Adobe APP14 marker that tricks jpeg-js
   into a YCbCr→RGB transform → green cast. Force `colorTransform: false` for
   `RGB`; `true` for any `YBR_*`.

### Verified end to end (against the fixture)

- `/api` surfaces `cptac-brca_dicom` as `dicom-wsi`, `rgb24`, base
  `53783×49534×1`, 4 levels.
- `raw.nii.gz?level=3` → correct H&E thumbnail of the whole slide.
- `raw.nii.gz?level=0&bbox=...` → a 2048-cube of cellular detail (nuclei,
  adipocytes, stroma) pulled from the 2.66 GP base in tens of ms.

## 4. Download + registration

```sh
bun apps/iiif-volumetric-server/scripts/fetch-dicom-wsi.ts \
  --series=<SeriesInstanceUID> --name=<slug>
```

Defaults to the CPTAC-BRCA pyramid above. Pulls from the public NCI Imaging
Data Commons (`idc-open-data` S3); the series UUID is the bucket prefix. The
script drops a top-level symlink `fixtures/<slug>_dicom -> dicom-wsi/<slug>_dicom`
because the registry scan only reads the top level (mirrors how the OME-Zarr
fixtures are surfaced). Grab other series UUIDs from
<https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/>; thousands of SM (slide
microscopy) series exist across `cptac_*`, `tcga_*`, `htan_*`, `cmb_*`, `gtex`.

## 5. Why depth-1 RGB volume (vs a dedicated 2D deep-zoom viewer)

- `VolumeHandle` already has an `rgb24` dtype and the streaming endpoints
  already speak levels + bbox — zero new server surface.
- The client already has coarse-first LOD, chunk residency, and the exploded
  view. A slide is just a volume that happens to be one voxel deep.
- The natural WSI view is the **2D axial slice** (= the slide face) with
  pan/zoom driving LOD — exactly the pathology deep-zoom UX, reusing the slice
  path rather than the 3D ray-march.

---

## 6. Browser viewer (done) — `wsi.html`

`apps/iiif-volumetric-demo/wsi.html` + `src/wsi.ts` is a deep-zoom slide
viewer built on the single-texture RGB path (no niivue changes):

- niivue loads each level as a depth-1 `rgb24` volume (datatype 128 → uploaded
  straight to `rgba8unorm` via `rgba2Texture`) drawn as a 2D axial slice — the
  slide face. Verified that niivue accepts `[W,H,1]` RGB volumes for both a
  whole coarse level and a bbox subvolume.
- **Smooth OpenSeadragon-style zoom/pan**: the view is tracked as a viewport
  over the slide — a centre and a span, both in base-level pixels — which the
  wheel (centred zoom) and drag (pan) handlers own directly, re-aiming niivue's
  2D pan/zoom (`pan2Dxyzmm`) each frame via `setNiivueView`. We drive it
  ourselves rather than using niivue's built-in wheel zoom because that anchors
  on the crosshair and, for a window volume whose mm origin isn't at its centre,
  drifts the view — so `primaryDragMode` is `none` and the viewport state is
  authoritative (no mm round-trip, no drift).
- **Auto-LOD with a margin window**: a window `MARGIN`× larger than the viewport
  is loaded, so small zooms/pans stay within the texture. A debounced settle
  pass swaps the pyramid level (and reloads the window, scale-matched and
  recentred so the framing is preserved) only when a texel would grow past
  `TEXEL_BLUR` / shrink below `TEXEL_WASTE` screen pixels, or the view nears the
  window edge — picking the level whose pixels are ~1:1 with the screen. The
  dead-band stops levels thrashing during a continuous zoom.
- **Whole-slide overview**: the coarsest level fits one texture and loads whole.
- **Deep zoom**: finer levels exceed the 2048 texture limit, so the viewer
  loads only the visible window via the bbox subvolume read — the
  2.66-gigapixel base level is never materialised.
- Controls: scroll to zoom (centred), drag to pan, a log-scaled zoom slider, a
  level dropdown, double-click / "zoom in" to dive at centre, a "whole slide"
  reset, and a minimap with a viewport box and click-to-jump. Navigation math
  (level pick with the texture-fit guard, margin-window placement,
  viewport→niivue mapping) is in `wsi.ts`.

### Remaining follow-up — chunked RGB streaming

The viewer stays on the single-texture path because niivue's **chunked** orient
path rejects RGB/RGBA (`gl/orientChunked.ts` and `wgpu/orientChunked.ts` throw
for dt 128/2304). Supporting it would let the whole base level stream as tiled
chunks (smooth pan across full resolution, and the exploded view) instead of
the windowed load. The work: per-chunk RGB→RGBA8 extraction + upload (mirroring
the single-texture `rgba2Texture` bypass) on both backends, plus the gradient
pass (or skip it for the 2D slice path). Until then, windowed deep-zoom is the
intended WSI UX and needs no chunked support.

### Other nice-to-haves

- Surface the LABEL / OVERVIEW ancillary images (currently dropped from the
  pyramid) as a slide thumbnail.
- Lazy per-frame range reads of the base instance instead of buffering all
  422 MB into the per-level cache.
- WSI `PixelSpacing` is often absent (then `[1,1]`, square pixels). If a slide
  carries real spacing, confirm coarse-level spacing scales so levels register.

## 7. niivue integration contract (no niivue changes)

The OSD-style WSI navigation required **zero changes to niivue source** — it is
entirely demo code (`apps/iiif-volumetric-demo/src/wsi.ts`) driving niivue's
existing public API. This section pins down exactly which niivue behaviours the
viewer depends on, so a future niivue change that breaks one is recognised as
breaking WSI navigation.

### API surface the viewer relies on

| niivue API | How the WSI viewer uses it |
| --- | --- |
| `new NiiVue({ primaryDragMode: DRAG_MODE.none, backend })` | Disables niivue's own drag/zoom so the viewer fully owns pan/zoom (see the quirk below). |
| `nv.loadVolumes([{ url }])` | Loads each pyramid level / window — an `rgb24` NIfTI from the server — as an ordinary volume. |
| RGB volume support (`datatypeCode` 128 → `rgba8unorm` via `rgba2Texture`) | A WSI level is a depth-1 **RGB** volume; niivue uploads it straight to an RGBA8 texture (`wgpu/orient.ts` / `gl/orientOverlay.ts`), no colormap. |
| Depth-1 volume + `nv.sliceType = SLICE_TYPE.AXIAL` | A `[W, H, 1]` volume's axial slice **is** the slide face. |
| `nv.pan2Dxyzmm` (`vec4` `[panX_mm, panY_mm, panZ_mm, zoom]`) | The viewer writes this every frame to aim the 2D view; it is the entire camera. |
| `nv.drawScene()` | Repaint after the viewer changes `pan2Dxyzmm`. |

### The 2D ortho contract we invert

`setNiivueView()` depends on the exact 2D-ortho math in
`math/NVTransforms.ts:calculateMvpMatrix2D` (and the pan mapping in
`view/NVSliceLayout.ts:slicePanUV`):

- **visible width** on screen = `volumeWidthMM / zoom`
- **screen-centre** (mm) = `volumeCentreMM - panU`

Expressed relative to the volume centre (which maps to the window centre
regardless of the affine origin), that inverts to the `setNiivueView` /
viewport formulas in `wsi.ts`. WSI volumes carry spacing `[1,1,1]`, so
`base-px-per-mm = level downsample factor`. If niivue's 2D pan/zoom convention
changes, these formulas must change with it.

### The quirk we work around

niivue's built-in 2D **wheel zoom anchors on the crosshair**
(`control/interactions.ts`, the `isPanZoomMode` branch:
`pan2Dxyzmm[0] += zoomChange * scene2mm(crosshairPos)[0]`). For a volume whose
mm origin is **not** at its centre — which our server-built window volumes are —
that term is non-zero and the view **drifts toward a corner** as you zoom. So
the viewer sets `primaryDragMode: none` (which disables that branch) and drives
a **centred** wheel zoom and a drag pan itself, writing `pan2Dxyzmm` directly.
This is the single most important niivue-facing detail of the WSI work.

### The one niivue limitation that bounds the design

niivue renders **one texture per volume**; there is no native tiling of a single
volume, and the chunked path **rejects RGB** (`gl/orientChunked.ts` /
`wgpu/orientChunked.ts` throw for datatype 128/2304). So the deep-zoom across
the gigapixel slide is orchestrated by the demo (swap which window niivue
shows), not by niivue. Adding RGB to the chunked orient path is the change that
would let niivue stream the whole base level itself — see §6 "Remaining
follow-up".
